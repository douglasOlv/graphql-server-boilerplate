# learning-graphql
I started this repository with the purpose of learning GraphQL and ended having a lot of fun

## What i used
- [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

## Result
This GraphQL service works, is an interation where "Users" make a "Posts", so this interation is delivery by GraphQL as needed.
